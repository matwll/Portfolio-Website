# Portfolio Website

## Description

This is my portfolio webpage for potential employers.
It showcases a few projects I have made as well as providing links to those projects.
This project solves my problem of having to print out and carry around samples of my work for potential employers.
While making this I learned alot about flexbox, divs, and mediaqueries.
